TO-DO :
1. add a test() function which will use test dataset to check network's performance
2. remove the current couts (they actually mean nothing since no test func excists)
3. re-write parts of code in order code to become cache friendly
4. re-write all functions that return pointers , so it won't be necessary to use new/delete the whole time
5. dont forget to free the memory before exiting main
